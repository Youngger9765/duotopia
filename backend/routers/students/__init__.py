Student routers module.

Refactored from monolithic students.py (1548 lines) into modular structure.

Structure:
- auth.py: Authentication endpoints
- profile.py: Profile management and stats
- assignments.py: Assignment operations
- recordings.py: Audio recording uploads
- email_verification.py: Email verification flows
- account_management.py: Account switching and linking
- validators.py: Pydantic schemas
- dependencies.py: Shared dependencies
