## Review Process

### Phase 1: Scope Analysis

### Phase 3: Performance Review
- [ ] Database query optimization (N+1 queries)
- [ ] Proper indexing
- [ ] Caching strategy
- [ ] Bundle size impact
- [ ] Lazy loading implemented
- [ ] Memory leaks prevented

### Phase 4: Code Quality
- [ ] DRY principle followed
- [ ] SOLID principles applied
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Meaningful variable names
- [ ] Functions < 50 lines
- [ ] Cyclomatic complexity < 10
- [ ] Test coverage adequate
- [ ] **File size limits respected** (see File Size Check below)

### Phase 5: Documentation
- [ ] Code comments for complex logic
- [ ] API documentation updated
- [ ] README updated if needed
- [ ] Type definitions complete

## Severity Levels

- **🔴 Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, data loss risks, breaking changes
- **⚠️ Warning**: Performance issues, code smells, missing tests
- **💡 Info**: Style improvements, minor optimizations

## Tools Usage

1. **Grep** - Search for security patterns and anti-patterns
2. **Read** - Examine specific files in detail
3. **WebSearch** - Check latest security advisories
4. **Glob** - Find related files that might be affected

## File Size Check (CONTEXT-AWARE)

**INTELLIGENT**: File size checks adapt based on code context (POC vs Production).

### Thresholds (Context-Aware)

#### Production Code (`routers/`, `pages/`, `components/`, etc.)
- **500 lines**: ⚠️ Warning - Consider refactoring if adding >50 lines
- **1000 lines**: 🔴 Critical - MUST refactor before major changes
- **Action**: Strict enforcement for maintainability

#### POC/Experimental Code (`poc_*`, `demo_*`, `experiments/`, etc.)
- **1000 lines**: 💡 Info - Gentle suggestion only
- **2000 lines**: ⚠️ Warning - Performance concern (slow IDE)
- **Action**: Relaxed, user can continue without refactoring

#### General Code
- **500 lines**: 💡 Info - Notice only
- **1000 lines**: ⚠️ Warning - Recommend refactoring
- **Action**: Moderate enforcement

#### Documentation Files (`.md`)
- **800 lines**: 💡 Suggestion to split into topics

### User Override
Users can skip checks by adding to file header:
```python
# file-size-check: ignore
# Reason: POC for new feature, will refactor after validation
```

### Detection Process
```bash
# Count lines in modified files
wc -l [file_path]

# Automatic context detection:
# - POC patterns: poc_*, demo_*, test_*, experiments/
# - Production patterns: routers/, pages/, components/
# - Apply appropriate threshold based on context
```

### Response Protocol

#### Production Code > 1000 lines (CRITICAL)
1. **STOP** and mark as 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUE
2. **ANALYZE** file structure:
   ```python
   # Example analysis
   - Line 1-500: Classroom CRUD operations
   - Line 501-1000: Student management logic
   - Line 1001-1500: Assignment operations
   - Line 1501-2000: Utility functions
   ```
3. **RECOMMEND** specific modularization:
   ```
   Suggested split for routers/teachers.py (3237 lines):
   routers/teachers/
     __init__.py           # Main router (200 lines)
     classroom_ops.py      # Classroom operations (800 lines)
     student_ops.py        # Student management (900 lines)
     assignment_ops.py     # Assignment operations (800 lines)
     utils.py              # Helper functions (300 lines)
     validators.py         # Input validation (237 lines)
   ```
4. **REQUIRE** user approval before allowing changes

#### Production Code 500-1000 lines (WARNING)
1. **WARN** in report
2. **SUGGEST** refactoring if adding significant code (>50 lines)
3. **DOCUMENT** technical debt

#### POC Code 1000-2000 lines (INFO)
1. **INFO** - Gentle suggestion only
2. **MENTION** refactoring when moving to production
3. **ALLOW** to continue without refactoring

#### POC Code > 2000 lines (WARNING)
1. **WARN** about performance issues (slow IDE, long build times)
2. **SUGGEST** splitting even for POC
3. **ALLOW** to continue with awareness

### Report Format
```markdown
### 📏 File Size Analysis

#### 🔴 Critical - Production Code Too Large
- `backend/routers/teachers.py` - **3237 lines** (🏭 Production, Limit: 1000)
  - **Impact**: Hard to maintain, difficult code review, slow IDE
  - **Recommended split**: See modularization plan above
  - **Action**: MUST refactor before making major changes

#### ⚠️ Warning - Consider Refactoring
- `frontend/src/pages/ClassroomDetail.tsx` - **723 lines** (🏭 Production, Limit: 500)
  - **Suggestion**: Extract hooks to separate files
  - **Action**: Refactor if adding >50 lines

#### 💡 Info - POC File Notice
- `backend/poc_new_feature.py` - **1500 lines** (🧪 POC/Experimental)
  - **Notice**: This is experimental code, size limits are relaxed
  - **Suggestion**: Consider refactoring when moving to production
  - **Action**: You may continue without refactoring
```

### Context Detection
The hook automatically detects file context:

**POC/Experimental indicators**:
- Filename: `poc_*`, `demo_*`, `temp_*`, `draft_*`, `test_*`
- Directory: `poc/`, `experiments/`, `prototypes/`, `scripts/`, `tools/`
- Test files: `test_*.py`, `*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts`

**Production code indicators**:
- Directory: `routers/`, `pages/`, `components/`, `services/`, `models/`, `api/`

## Auto-Review Triggers

Automatically perform review when detecting:
- SQL queries without parameterization
- Direct DOM manipulation in React
- Missing error boundaries
- Uncaught promise rejections
- Missing authentication checks
- Large bundle size increases
- **Files exceeding 500 lines** (File Size Check)

## Example Commands

```bash
# Find potential SQL injection
grep -r "query.*\+.*request\." backend/

# Check for hardcoded secrets
grep -r "API_KEY\|SECRET\|PASSWORD" --include="*.py" --include="*.ts"

# Find console.log statements
grep -r "console\.log" frontend/src/

# Check test coverage
cd backend && pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing
```
